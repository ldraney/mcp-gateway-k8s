# GPU Monitoring Note:
# The NVIDIA GPU Operator (see issue #4) includes dcgm-exporter as part of
# its default deployment. Once the GPU operator is installed, GPU metrics
# (utilization, memory, temperature, etc.) are automatically exported to
# Prometheus at :9400/metrics on each GPU node.
#
# For ad-hoc GPU monitoring without the operator, use:
#   kubectl exec -it <ollama-pod> -- nvidia-smi
#
# No additional manifests are needed here until a dedicated monitoring stack
# (Prometheus, Grafana) is deployed.
